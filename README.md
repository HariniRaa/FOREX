Forex Currency prediction using LSTM


Predicting Indian currency rates wrto the following currency pairs:
1)INR-USD
2)INR-GBP
3)INR-JPY
4)INR-EUR


INR- Indian Rupee
USD- United States Dollar
JPY- Japan Yen
EUR- Euro

Predicting the highest currency rate of a particular day based on historic rates.
The csv documents contain the highest,lowest,closing and opening prices on a daily basiuc for a period of five years.
The code when modified slightly can also predict closing,opening or lowest proce of a given day.
This is purely academic and a very simple take on prediction which doesn't take into account the various complex factors that affect forex rates.
